These are questions that are good to ask as an *interviewee*, a candidate for a developer job.

* What's the best part of the job?
* What's the worst part of the job?
    * Put more nicely: What do you most wish you could change about the job?
* How many meetings do you have in an average week? How long are they? What's the content?
* What does your deployment process look like? How long does it take? Who does it? How often?
* How long are your iterations?
* How long are your standups?
* How much pairing does the team do?
* How much test coverage do you have? Do you have end-to-end tests as well?
* What branching strategy do you use?
* What's your code review process?
* How do you track stories, tasks, bugs?
* How does work get from the customer to the developers? Is there a feedback loop?
* How do the developers and testers interact?
* How do the developers and designers interact?
* How big is your backlog? What state is it in? How often is it groomed?
* How are developers protected from distractions?

Here are some questions to quickly get at whether a team is doing "fake agile":

1. Can you tell me about all the meetings you have in an average week?
2. What does your deployment process look like, how long does it take, who does it, and how often?
3. What processes do you have that could use significant improvement?


What You Need To Convey
-----------------------

As recommended by my buddy Jim Leingang, an interviewee needs only convince the interviewer(s) of 3 things:

* I can do the job
* I want the job
* I can be trusted

One other piece of advice he gave (for a phone interview):

* Smile
