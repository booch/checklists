This is a checklist to ensure that I do my best to get as many people to read my articles as possible.

* Tweet from my personal account
* Tweet from my business account, if applicable
* Tweet from the podcast account, if applicable
* Ask people you know well who might be interested to read and/or tweet about the article
* Tweet again a little later, for those that might have missed the first tweet
* Post to Hacker news, if applicable
* Post to Reddit, if applicable
